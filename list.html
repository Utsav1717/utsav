<dt style="font-size: xx-large;  color: red"> Dewas</dt>
<dd>Welcome to the city of Dewas, which is located in the Malwa plateau and is an old town in Madhya Pradesh. The city is administrative center of the Dewas district. Two theories prevail about the name of the city , one being that Dewas lies on the foot of Chamunda hill on top of which is the shrine of Goddess Chamunda, from which the name is derived Dewas (dev-vas) meaning Devi Vashini or the Goddess residence (abode of the Deity or God).The other theory is that maybe the name was given as a mark of respect to the founder of the village Dewasa Bania. Dewas is a fast-developing industrial town with the government’s bank note press located in the city.

During the 18th century, the city briefly became the capital of the Scindia state of the Maratha Empire, when Ranoji Scindia established his capital at Ujjain in 1731. It remained an important political, commercial and cultural centre of Central India until the early 19th century, when the British administrators decided to develop Indore as an alternative to it. Ujjain continues to be an important place of pilgrimage for Shaivites, Vaishnavites and Shaktas</dd>
